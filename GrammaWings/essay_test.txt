Dear teacher,

My name is Li Hua. I’m writing a letter to you to ask for some help.
I have met much difficulty in learning English. First, I find our texts full of new words that are very difficult for me to remember. Besides, the texts are too long for me to recite. What’s more, grammar is also very difficult to learn.
Faced with so much difficulty, I have to ask you for some help. Would you like to introduce to us some good ways to learn new words so that we can remember them more easily? In the meanwhile, I beg you to teach the text more slowly so that the average students can easily follow you. Also, I would like you to introduce some rules and good ways to learn grammar.
I’m sure that I can make great progress in my English study with your help.
